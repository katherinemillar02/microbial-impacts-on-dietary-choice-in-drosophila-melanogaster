## Analysis

                         ratio  * Conditioned * Unconditioned * block
                       
                       + (1|block/plate) + (1|block/observation) , family = binomial, data = df2_virgin)

## Looking for interaction in 4-way
drop1(glmm.bin.v.011, test = "Chisq")
 # No interaction found

## Looking for 3-way interactions 
glmm.bin.v.2 <- glmer(cbind(Conditioned, Unconditioned) 
                        
                        ~ ratio  * Conditioned * Unconditioned +
                          block * Conditioned * Unconditioned + 
                          Conditioned * block * ratio + 
                          Unconditioned * block * ratio 
                        
                        + (1|block/plate) + (1|block/observation) , family = binomial, data = df2_virgin)



## Testing for sig in 3-way interactions 
drop1(glmm.bin.v.2, test = "Chisq")
 # A 3-way interaction found between ratio, unconditioned, and block... 



## After finding a significant 3-way interaction effect, I have two ways
## (I don't know which one is the proper) - for testing the 2-way interaction effects first 


## The first is just testing the 2 way interaction effects WITH the 3-way interaction effects 
glmm.bin.v.3 <- glmer(cbind(Conditioned, Unconditioned)

                        block : Unconditioned + 
                        Conditioned : Unconditioned + 

                        Unconditioned : block : ratio

drop1(glmm.bin.v.3, test = "Chisq")
## The issue here, is it only shows me results from 3 two-way interaction effects... 
## Would I then just use summary to test, and which would show them all? 
##  2-way interaction effect between ratio and conditioned 
##  the same 3-way interaction effect between ratio, unconditioned, and block... 

## seeing if i can find more results
summary(glmm.bin.v.3)
## suggests a ratio and block interaction effect? 
## doesnt look like there is conditioned/unconditioned and block effects
## which would track with drop 1



## If this is the case, then the final model: 
glmm.bin.v.4 <- glmer(cbind(Conditioned, Unconditioned) 
                      
                      ~ ratio + block + Conditioned + Unconditioned + 
                        
                        ratio : Conditioned +
                        ratio : block + 
                       
                        Unconditioned : block : ratio 
                      
                      
                      + (1|block/plate) + (1|block/observation) , family = binomial, data = df2_virgin)


drop1(glmm.bin.v.4, test = "Chisq")

# final model results?

## Alternative...

                      ~ ratio * Conditioned +
                        ratio * block +

                        block * Unconditioned + 
                        Conditioned * Unconditioned 
                        

                      
                      + (1|block/plate) + (1|block/observation) , family = binomial, data = df2_virgin)



drop1(glmm.bin.v.32, test = "Chisq")
## shows all but says only ratio and cond is sig, which is contrary to other model technique? 
summary(glmm.bin.v.32)
## says more is significant?
