## Model 1 
# Binomial GLM model
glm.bin.m.ovi.2choice <- glm(cbind(Conditioned, Unconditioned) ~ ratio, family = binomial, data = df2_male_oviposition)

## Assumption checking 

## easystats

## qq 
performance::check_model(glm.bin.m.ovi.2choice, check = c("qq")) ## the qq for this model looks pretty good

## different qq
residuals_m <- residuals(glm.bin.m.ovi.2choice, type = "pearson")
qnorm(residuals_m)
qqnorm(residuals_m)
qqline(residuals_m) ## there are still some dispersed lines 

## Homogeneity 
performance::check_model(glm.bin.m.ovi.2choice, check = c("homogeneity")) 
## there is still some dispersion between variables
## not everything completley lines up 

## Another way to look at qq and homogeneity 
plot(glm.bin.m.ovi.2choice) ## similar results, points aren't completley together 

## Using DHARMa
testDispersion(glm.bin.m.ovi.2choice) ## This is quite bad? 
## seems to be quite overdispersed 

check_overdispersion(glm.bin.m.ovi.2choice) ## model is quite overdispersed 

## Looking at qq and homogenity again
simulation_Output <- simulateResiduals(fittedModel = glm.bin.m.ovi.2choice, plot = F)
plot(simulation_Output) 
## This shows even worse results, why is this? 


#### The assumptions of a Binomial GLM weren't great, so trying a GLMM. 




## Model 2
## Trying a Binomial GLMM to consider random effects. 
glmm.bin.m.ovi.2choice <- glmer(cbind(Conditioned, Unconditioned) ~ ratio * block + (1|plate)  , family = binomial, data = df2_male_oviposition)


## Assumption Checking 

## qq checking 
performance::check_model(glmm.bin.m.ovi.2choice, check = c("qq")) 
## This qqplot seems to go more off at the end 
## but dots are sort of on the line 


## different qq
residuals_m_mixed <- residuals(glmm.bin.m.ovi.2choice, type = "pearson")
qnorm(residuals_m_mixed)
qqnorm(residuals_m_mixed)
qqline(residuals_m_mixed)
## There is some weird dispersion, goes off at the end 


## Homogeneity assumption checking 
performance::check_model(glmm.bin.m.ovi.2choice, check = c("homogeneity")) 
## This is all a lot less lined up than the binomial model 
## assumptions do not look greatly met here 

## other ways to look as assumptions 
plot(glmm.bin.m.ovi.2choice) ## This doesn't generate everything? 

## Using DHARMa 
## looking for overdispersion 
testDispersion(glmm.bin.m.ovi.2choice) ## This looks pretty good

# easystats dispersion check 
check_overdispersion(glmm.bin.m.ovi.2choice) ## still says overdispersion is detected 

## More ways to look at qq and homogeneity
simulation_Output <- simulateResiduals(fittedModel = glmm.bin.m.ovi.2choice, plot = T)
plot(simulation_Output) 
## Not much really lines up well in either of these 


## Comparing the two models 
AIC(glm.bin.m.ovi.2choice, glmm.bin.m.ovi.2choice)
## It says the mixed model has a much lower AIC,
## even though I think the assumptions look a bit worse? 

## Changing "ratio" to 4:1 
df2_male_oviposition$ratio <- as.factor(df2_male_oviposition$ratio)
df2_male_oviposition$ratio <- relevel(df2_male_oviposition$ratio, ref = "4:1")

## Changing block to "two" (as one will not be used for oviposition data)
df2_male_oviposition$block <- as.factor(df2_male_oviposition$block)
df2_male_oviposition$block <- relevel(df2_male_oviposition$block, ref = "one")


## Choosing the mixed model for now: 
glmm.bin.m.ovi.2choice <- glmer(cbind(Conditioned, Unconditioned) ~ ratio * block + (1|block/plate)  , family = binomial, data = df2_male_oviposition)

## Looking for the significance in Block
drop1(glmm.bin.m.ovi.2choice, test = "Chisq") ## says block is quite significant, keeping it in the model


## Using model for now, looking at results: 
summary(glmm.bin.m.ovi.2choice) ## says block is significant 

exp(confint(glmm.bin.m.ovi.2choice, method = "Wald"))



## Looking at the response variables for analysis
emmeans::emmeans(glmm.bin.m.ovi.2choice, ~ ratio + block , type = "response")

### OvoD1 Female  Oviposition ####
################################## --


## Model 1 

# Binomial model 
glm.bin.of.ovi.2choice <- glm(cbind(Conditioned, Unconditioned) ~ ratio * block, family = binomial, data = df2_ovod1_oviposition)

# Assumption checking 

# easystats does not work at the moment 
performance::check_model(glm.bin.of.ovi.2choice , check = c("qq")) ## looks okay

## comparing this with a different qqplot to understand qq plots 
## Generating residuals 
residuals <- residuals(glm.bin.of.ovi.2choice, type = "pearson")
qnorm(residuals)
## Will generate a qq 
qqnorm(residuals) ## qq looks bad 
qqline(residuals, col = "green") ## putting a line there to understand it better

## Understanding the qqplot:  
## There are points in the data below where the data should fall?
## should be straight across if in ascending order? 

## Homogeneity
# easystats plot
performance::check_model(glm.bin.of.ovi.2choice , check = c("homogeneity")) ## the dots are not really lines up 
# first one should be homogeneity
plot(glm.bin.of.ovi.2choice) ## lines look sort of lined up but not the best

## Understanding homogeneity: 
# Assumptions: the level of variance for a particular variable is constant across the sample 
# Groups of data: the variance of the outcome variable should be the same in each group
# So, I think the dots should sort of be in line with eachother? 
# This doesn't really happen, so there isn't a great assumption of homogeneity? 



#### MORE ASSUMPTION CHECKS
# DHARMa 
testDispersion(glm.bin.of.ovi.2choice) # looks pretty poor
## easystats overdispersion check
check_overdispersion(glm.bin.of.ovi.2choice) ## overdispersion 

## Understanding overdispersion 
## There is quite a lot of overdispersion
## This means that the variance of the response variable (fly numbers) is greater than what is
## expected by the model

## Another qqplot 
simulationOutput <- simulateResiduals(fittedModel = glm.bin.of.ovi.2choice, plot = T)
## is predicted the same as fitted? 
## is the second plot homogeneity assumptions? 

## understanding the qqplot shows the points are off the usual data and the second plot shows there is not 
## really homogeneity of variance 

## Overall, this model is really not the best...




## Model 2 ##

## Binomial GLMM - to consider random effects 
glmm.bin.of.ovi.2choice <- glmer(cbind(Conditioned, Unconditioned) ~ ratio * block + (1|plate)  , family = binomial, data = df2_ovod1_oviposition)


# Assumption checking 
# easystats 
performance::check_model(glmm.bin.of.ovi.2choice, check = c("qq"))
## this qqplot looks pretty good, this means the data falls through quite a nice distribution
## data is expected to fall the way the data falls 

## different way of doing a qqplot
## Generating residuals 
residuals <- residuals(glmm.bin.of.ovi.2choice, type = "pearson")
qnorm(residuals)
## Will generate a qq 
qqnorm(residuals) ## qq looks a lot better 
qqline(residuals, col = "green") ## again, points seem to fall along the line 


## Homogeneity check 
performance::check_model(glmm.bin.of.ovi.2choice, check = c("homogeneity")) 
## There is still not great homogeneity assumptions 
## This means the level of variance is not really constant still 



## MORE ASSUMPTIONS CHECKS 
# DHARMa 

## Looking for overdispersion
testDispersion(glmm.bin.of.ovi.2choice) # looks a lot better I think 

# easystats check for overdispersion 
check_overdispersion(glmm.bin.of.ovi.2choice) ## there is still overdispersion detected 


## More DHARMa assumption checks 
simulationOutput <- simulateResiduals(fittedModel = glmm.bin.of.ovi.2choice, plot = T)
## DHARMa assumption checks show the model to look a lot better 

## Doing an AIC check
AIC(glm.bin.of.ovi.2choice, glmm.bin.of.ovi.2choice)
## The model with random effects (Model 2) is a lot better, as expected from the other assumptions... 

## Using "Model 2" for now as I do not really know what else to do 

## Model choice: 
glmm.bin.of.ovi.2choice <- glmer(cbind(Conditioned, Unconditioned) ~ ratio + block + (1|plate/block)  , family = binomial, data = df2_ovod1_oviposition)

emmeans::emmeans(glmm.bin.of.ovi.2choice, ~ ratio, type = "response")

summary(glmm.bin.of.ovi.2choice)

## Looking for significance in block
drop1(glmm.bin.of.ovi.2choice, test = "Chisq") ## block is  significant with ratio

## Looking at results, keeping block in 

## Basic summary
summary(glmm.bin.of.ovi.2choice) 

## What I am confused about here: 
# If I am interpreting the results right, why is there no 1:4 conditioned/unconditioned block 2 results??
