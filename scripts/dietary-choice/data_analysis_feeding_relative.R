## Creating a data column where flies are not on the plate - possibly analysis to consider at some point?
df2_male <- df2_male %>% mutate(no_flies = 10 - (Conditioned + Unconditioned)) ## This is currently not used in any of the models

## MODELS 

## MODEL 1
## A binomial model, not considering other "random" factors
## cbind() is used - the response variables are Conditioned and Unconditioned
glm.bin.m <- glm(cbind(Conditioned, Unconditioned) ~ ratio * block, family = binomial, data = df2_male)

# ASSUMPTION CHECKING:
## Checking Residuals
glm.bin.m.residuals <- residuals(glm.bin_m, type = "pearson")

# pearson residual check

## MODEL CHECK for overdispersion

## MODEL 2 
# trying a mixed model, considers other "random" factors

## Assumption checks 

# Performance check of data using "easystats":
performance::check_model(glmm.bin.m, check = c("qq")) # qq looks pretty good 
performance::check_model(glmm.bin.m, check = c("homogeneity")) #?? 

## DHARMa performance checks
testDispersion(glmm.bin.m) 

# Model is okay to be used? 

## AIC Check of models 
AIC(glm.bin.m, glmm.bin.m)

## Binomial GLMM has a slighty lower AIC

# Using MODEL 2 (Binomial GLMM) for analysis? 

# Looking for significance in "block"

## Trying to look at the results of the model using emmeans()
emmeans::emmeans(glmm.bin.m.2, pairwise ~ ratio , random = ~ (1|plate) + (1|observation))
# Really want to look at Conditioned vs Unconditioned?
## Need to know how to interpret this model

  ## It says Bin GLM is better than Bin GLMM? 

## Confused about what to pick, going for the mixed model for now?
