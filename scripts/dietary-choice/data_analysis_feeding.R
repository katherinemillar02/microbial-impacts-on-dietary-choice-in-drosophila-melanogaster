# GLM with poisson 
glm.pois.of.4choice <- glm(fly_numbers ~ diet * block, family = poisson, data = combined_of)

# Assumption checks of model
performance::check_model(glm.pois.of.4choice, check = c("qq")) # doesn't look great - banana

# Checking for zero inflation

## New model with all interactions
zi.p.of.4choice.2 <- zeroinfl(fly_numbers ~ ratio * condition * block + ratio * condition + ratio * block + condition * block, dist = "negbin", link = "logit", data = combined_of )

# Testing for interaction effect
drop1(zi.p.of.4choice.2, test = "Chisq") ## No 3-way interaction effect 

# New model without a 3-way interaction
zi.p.of.4choice.3 <- zeroinfl(fly_numbers ~  ratio * condition + ratio * block + condition * block, dist = "negbin", link = "logit", data = combined_of )

## Testing for 2-way interaction effects
drop1(zi.p.of.4choice.3, test = "Chisq") 
 ## Interaction effect found between condition and block, and ratio and condition 

## Final model?
zi.p.of.4choice.4 <- zeroinfl(fly_numbers ~  ratio * condition  + condition * block , dist = "negbin", link = "logit", data = combined_of )

## Testing for remaining interaction effects
