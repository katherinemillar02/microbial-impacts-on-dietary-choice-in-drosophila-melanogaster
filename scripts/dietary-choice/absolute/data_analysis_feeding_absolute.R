## Data Analysis 

## Doing poisson to begin with 
glm.pois.m.4choice <- glm(fly_numbers ~ diet * block, family = poisson, data = combined_m)

# Doing assumption checks before seeing if overdispersion can be checked
performance::check_model(glm.pois.m.4choice, check = c("qq")) # qq looks ok?
performance::check_model(glm.pois.m.4choice, check = c("outliers")) # weird 
performance::check_model(glm.pois.m.4choice, check = c("homogeneity")) # does this look okay maybe? 


# Checking for overdispersion
summary(glm.pois.m.4choice) # A bit overdispersed 

# Look for 0s 
check_zeroinflation(glm.pois.m.4)
# there is zero inflation 

# There is overdispersion, this could be independent of or because of the zero inflation
# So trying negative binomial family 
## Trying to look for significance of experiment with a negative binomial model




# Negative binomial model
glm.nb.m.4choice <- glm.nb(fly_numbers ~ diet * block, data = combined_m)

# assumption checks for negative binomial model
# easystats
performance::check_model(glm.nb.m.4choice, check = c("qq")) # looks the same as glm poisson. 
performance::check_model(glm.nb.m.4choice, check = c("outliers")) # weird 
performance::check_model(glm.nb.m.4choice, check = c("homogeneity")) # looks the same again 

# Checking for overdispersion 
summary(glm.nb.m.4choice)
   # No evidence of overdispersion but still highly skewed residuals, do random effects help?





    # Trying a mixed model with GLM and poisson 
glmm.m.4choice <- glmmTMB(fly_numbers ~ diet * block + (1|factor(block)/plate) + (1|block/observation), family = poisson, data = combined_m)

## Assumption checks
performance::check_model(glmm.m.4, check = c("qq")) # qq looks a lot better

## Looking for inflation of zeros
check_zeroinflation(glmm.m.4) # There is still zero inflation 

# using DHARMa to look at residuals of new model 
simulateResiduals(fittedModel = glmm.m.4, plot = T)

# Trying a zero inflated poisson model with poisson
zi.pois.m.4choice <- zeroinfl(fly_numbers ~ diet * block | diet * block, dist = "poisson", link = "logit", data = combined_m)

## Assumption checks 
sresid <- residuals(zi.pois.m.4, type = "pearson")
pred <- fitted(zi.pois.m.4)
hist(sresid)
plot(sresid ~  pred)


# Trying a zero inflated negative binomial model 
zi.nb.m.4choice <- zeroinfl(fly_numbers ~ diet * block | diet * block, dist = "negbin", link = "logit", data = combined_m)

 


# Comparing AIC of the different models 
AIC(glm.pois.m.4choice, glm.nb.mchoice, glmm.m.4choice, zi.pois.m.4choice, zi.nb.m.4choice)
# glm_mm_m has the lowest AIC, but AIC values close to each other are basically the same (like 5 values?)






# This model to be chosen:
glmm.m.4choice <- glmmTMB(fly_numbers ~ diet * block + (1|factor(block)/plate) + (1|observation), family = poisson, data = combined_m)

## Testing for an interaction effect 
drop1(glmm.m.4, test = "Chi") # Small interaction, but still exists 



# With the chosen model, splitting up "diet" into ratio and condition.



## Splitting up diet within the actual data frame
combined_m_split <- combined_m %>%
     separate(diet, into = c("ratio", "condition"), sep = " ")


## Testing for interaction effects with the new model 
# Model 1 - glmm.m.4choice.2
glmm.m.4choice.2 <- glmmTMB(fly_numbers ~ ratio * condition * block + ratio * condition + ratio * block + condition * block + (1 | factor(block) / plate) + (1 | observation), family = poisson, data = combined_m_split)

#### JUST IN CASE I AM REQUIRED TO DO THIS, testing different models, with the new model design 

## Assumption checks for glmm.m.4choice.2
testDispersion(glmm.m.4choice.2)
  ## Looks underdispersed 


simulationOutput <- simulateResiduals(fittedModel = glmm.m.4choice.2, plot = T)

performance::check_model(glmm.m.4choice.2, check = c("qq"))
   ## Does not show qq results 

performance::check_model(glmm.m.4choice.2)
  ## Not sure what I am looking for, but I think the assumptions look ok? 

check_overdispersion(glmm.m.4choice.2)
  # Overdispersion detected

check_zeroinflation(glmm.m.4choice.2)
  # Probable zero inflation 

### The mixed model shows there is both overdispersion and zero inflation. 
    

## First, trying a zero-inflation model

## zero inflation with poisson
zi.pois.m.4choice.2 <- zeroinfl(fly_numbers ~ratio * condition * block + ratio * condition + ratio * block + condition * block | ratio * condition * block + ratio * condition + ratio * block + condition * block, dist = "poisson", link = "logit", data = combined_m_split)

## Assumption checks??

## zero inflation with neg bin
zi.nb.m.4choice.2 <- zeroinfl(fly_numbers ~ratio * condition * block + ratio * condition + ratio * block + condition * block | ratio * condition * block + ratio * condition + ratio * block + condition * block, dist = "negbin", link = "logit", data = combined_m_split)

## Assumption checks??

## Negative Binomial GLM
glm.nb.m.4choice.2 <- glm.nb(fly_numbers ~ ratio * condition * block + ratio * condition + ratio * block + condition * block, data = combined_m_split)


## Assumption checks
simulationOutput <- simulateResiduals(fittedModel = glm.nb.m.4choice.2, plot = T)
  ## Not sure what the red represents 

check_zeroinflation(glm.nb.m.4choice.2) ## No zero inflation 

check_overdispersion(glm.nb.m.4choice.2) ## No overdispersion 

AIC(glmm.m.4choice.2, zi.pois.m.4choice.2, zi.nb.m.4choice.2, glm.nb.m.4choice.2)
  # GLMM has lowest AIC, BUT is overdispersed and has zero infaltion - choosing anyway... 







## Chosen Model... 
glmm.m.4choice.2 <- glmmTMB(fly_numbers ~ ratio * condition * block + (1 | factor(block) / plate) + (1 | factor(block)/observation), family = poisson, data = combined_m_split)


## This will show results for the 3-way interaction
drop1(glmm.m.4choice.2, test = "Chisq")

## This shows everything
summary(glmm.m.4choice.2)

## Results show there is no 3-way interaction, so this can be removed
## Testing 2-way interactions
glmm.m.4choice.3 <- glmmTMB(fly_numbers ~  ratio + condition + block + ratio : block + condition : block  + ratio:condition + (1 | factor(block) / plate) + (1 | observation), family = poisson, data = combined_m_split)

drop1(glmm.m.4choice.3, test = "Chisq") ## An interaction between condition and block found? the others can be dropped

## Newest model - final model 
glmm.m.4choice.4 <- glmmTMB(fly_numbers ~  ratio + condition * block + (1 | factor(block) / plate) + (1 | observation), family = poisson, data = combined_m_split)


#### Assumption checks of the chosen model (with diet split)... 

testDispersion(glmm.m.4choice.4)
 ## Is it underdispersed?

simulationOutput <- simulateResiduals(fittedModel = glmm.m.4choice.4, plot = T)
 ## Not sure how to interpret this? I think it looks ok though?

residuals(simulationOutput)

residuals(simulationOutput, quantileFunction = qnorm, outlierValues = c(-7,7)) 

performance::check_model(glmm.m.4choice.4)
  ## Does this look ok? 

check_zeroinflation(glmm.m.4choice.4) 
  # There is zero inflation

check_overdispersion(glmm.m.4choice.4) 
  # Here it says there is overdispersion, even though I thought DHARMa showed undispersion... 


performance::check_model(glmm.m.4choice.4, check = c("qq"))
  ## It does not show the qq - why?


## Analysis of the results
