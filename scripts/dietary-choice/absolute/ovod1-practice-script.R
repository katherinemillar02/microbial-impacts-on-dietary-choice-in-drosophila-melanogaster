## Analysis, choosing Bin GLMM for now: 












## Using : as an interaction effect 


## First, testing for a four-way interaction effect. 
## Unlike *, this will just test for the four-way interaction effect?

## Test should show 3-way interaction effects 
drop1(glmm.bin.o.002, test = 'Chisq')

  ## Interaction effect between Unconditioned and Conditioned




## Testing for 2-way interaction effects

## Testing for interactions 
drop1(glmm.bin.o.0031, test = 'Chisq')

## Final Model?

## Using drop1 to find the appropriate interaction effects 
drop1(glmm.bin.o.004, test = 'Chisq')




















#### USING * IN THE MODELS: 

## Looking for a four-way interaction effect.
## Although this model will interact everything with everything. 
glmm.bin.o.01 <- glmer(cbind(Conditioned, Unconditioned) ~
                         ratio  * Conditioned * Unconditioned * block 
                       + (1|block/plate) + (1|block/observation) , family = binomial, data = df2_ovod1)

## Tests for just the four-way interaction effect
drop1(glmm.bin.o.01, test = 'Chisq')
   # No 4-way interaction effect. 



# Testing for three-way interaction effects. 
## Although this model will interact everything with everything, so will also look for two-way interaction effects. 
glmm.bin.o.02 <- glmer(cbind(Conditioned, Unconditioned) ~ 
                         
                         ratio  * Conditioned * Unconditioned 
                       + ratio   * Unconditioned * block 
                       + ratio  * Conditioned * block  
                       + block * ratio * Conditioned  
                       + block * ratio * Unconditioned 
                       + block * Conditioned * Unconditioned
                       
                       +  (1|block/plate) + (1|block/observation) , family = binomial, data = df2_ovod1)

## Looking for 3-way interaction effect, shows those first and only shows 4/6
drop1(glmm.bin.o.02, test = 'Chisq')
   ## A 3-way interaction effect between ratio, Unconditioned and block found


## Testing for 2-way interaction effects 



## This model tests for two-way interaction effects, but includes a previously significant 3-way interaction effect 
glmm.bin.o.03 <- glmer(cbind(Conditioned, Unconditioned)
                       ~ Unconditioned * block * ratio + 
                         Conditioned * Unconditioned +   
                         Conditioned * block + 
                         Conditioned * ratio +
                         Unconditioned * block + 
                         Unconditioned * ratio +
                         (1|block/plate) + (1|block/observation) , family = binomial, data = df2_ovod1)

# Testing for the two-way interaction effect. 
drop1(glmm.bin.o.03, test = 'Chisq')
 ## Still shows 3 - way interaction effect between ratio, Unconditioned and block. 
 ## Now shows 2-way interaction effect between ratio and Conditioned, but only shows 3/5 possible 2-way combinations. 



## This model is the same as above and tests for two-way interaction effects
## but DOES NOT include a previously significant 3-way interaction effect 
glmm.bin.o.031 <- glmer(cbind(Conditioned, Unconditioned)
                       ~  
                         Conditioned * Unconditioned +   
                         Conditioned * block + 
                         Conditioned * ratio +
                         Unconditioned * block + 
                         Unconditioned * ratio +
                         
                         (1|block/plate) + (1|block/observation) , family = binomial, data = df2_ovod1)


## Testing for the two-way interaction effects 
drop1(glmm.bin.o.031, test = 'Chisq')
 # No 2- way interactions? but shows all 5 possible 2-way combos written






## Final Model? 
glmm.bin.o.04 <- glmer(cbind(Conditioned, Unconditioned) ~ 
                         Unconditioned * block * ratio + Conditioned
                   
                         
                         (1|block/plate) + (1|block/observation) , family = binomial, data = df2_ovod1)


## Using drop1 to find the approprirate interaction effects 
drop1(glmm.bin.o.04, test = 'Chisq')
  ## Confused, I did not put an interaction effect between ratio and conditioned in the model so why is it doing it
  # Is it because of the *?
