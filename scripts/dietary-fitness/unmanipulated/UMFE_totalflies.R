#### Reading data in: ####
fly_fitness_UMFE <- read_excel("data/fitness_development/fly_data.xlsx")


## Making a tidy version of the data,
#### Puts males and females together into a "sex" column.
fly_fitness_tidy_UMFE <- tidyr::pivot_longer(data = fly_fitness_UMFE ,
                                        cols = c( females, males),
                                        names_to = "sex",
                                        values_to = "count") 



#### This code shows each vial, for each sex, and for each treatment
### this shows a TOTAL count for each vial, males and females in each vial over all the counts
### adds a column that looks at treatment and sex 
### EMERGENCE BY SEX
overallflies_UMFE <- fly_fitness_tidy_UMFE %>%
  filter(sex %in% c("females", "males")) %>%
  group_by(vial, sex, treatment) %>%
  summarise(total_count = sum(count, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(sex_treatment = paste(treatment, sex, sep = " ")) %>%
  mutate(sex_treatment = factor(sex_treatment,
                                levels = c("conditioned females", "unconditioned females",
                                           "conditioned males", "unconditioned males")))



#### TESTING MODELS ####


# Model 1
#### Poisson GLMM ####
glmm.p.total.UMFE <- glmmTMB(total_count ~ 
                               
                               sex * treatment, 
                             
                             
                             
                             family = poisson, data = overallflies_UMFE)


## assumption checking:
simulationOutput <- simulateResiduals(fittedModel = glmm.p.total.UMFE, plot = T)


#### Chosen model: Poisson GLMM ####

## assumptions could be better 
drop1(glmm.p.total.UMFE, test = "Chisq")






## model without interaction effect: 
glmm.p.total.UMFE.2 <- glmmTMB(total_count ~ 
                               
                               sex + treatment, 
                             
                             
                             
                             family = poisson, data = overallflies_UMFE)



#### DATA ANALYSIS ####
summary(glmm.p.total.UMFE.2)

tab_model(glmm.p.total.UMFE.2)



#### other versions 

## just incase the data wanted to be looked at in other ways. 


#### fly emergence overall 
#### EMERGENCE NOT BY SEX
fly_emergence_overall <- fly_fitness_tidy_UMFE %>%
  filter(sex %in% c("females", "males")) %>%
  group_by(vial, treatment) %>%
  summarise(overall_emergence = sum(count, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(sex_treatment = paste(treatment, "overall", sep = " ")) %>%
  mutate(sex_treatment = factor(sex_treatment,
                                levels = c("conditioned overall", "unconditioned overall")))




## An overall code of emergence per time
## THIS COMBINES THE VIALS
emergence_per_time <- fly_fitness %>%
  group_by(treatment, time_hours) %>%
  summarize(total_females = sum(females, na.rm = TRUE),
            total_males = sum(males, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup()
