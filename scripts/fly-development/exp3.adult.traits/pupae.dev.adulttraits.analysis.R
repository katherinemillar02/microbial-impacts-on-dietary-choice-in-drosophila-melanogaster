#### Reading, cleaning and organising the data ####

## Reading pupae data in with read excel
pupae_fitness_adultstraits <- read_excel("data/fitness_development/adulttraits_pupaedev.xlsx")

## This code does something with 0s - not sure if it needed... 
pupae_fitness_adultstraits <- pupae_fitness_adultstraits %>%
  mutate(pupae = ifelse(is.na(pupae), 0, pupae))

## The uncount code will simply clean the data
pupae_fitness_adultstraits_2 <- uncount(pupae_fitness_adultstraits, pupae)


## I now use this uncounted dataset, which works best for time. 

#### Preliminary Data Analysis #### 


#### 1. Testing Models ####


# Model 1 
#### Poisson GLMM #### 
glmm.p.pupae.at <- glmmTMB(time_hours ~ treatment  + (1| vial), family = poisson, 
                        data = pupae_fitness_adultstraits_2)



#### ASSUMPTION CHECKS:  
# DHARMa checks 
plot(simulateResiduals(glmm.p.pupae.at)) 
## Does not look great
# DHARMa assumptions shows this model is poor for both qq and homogeneity 
# tests are significant for both - new model needed


## Performance checks - easystats 

# Looking for zeroinflation
check_zeroinflation(glmm.p.pupae.at) 
## There NO is zero inflation, indicating issues may be coming from overdispersion 

# Looking for overdispersion 
check_overdispersion(glmm.p.pupae.at) 
## There is overdispersion, indicating a negative binomial model might be good to test 






# Model 2
#### Negative Binomial GLM ####
glm.nb_pupae.at <- glm.nb(time_hours ~ 
                         treatment   
                       
                       , data = pupae_fitness_adultstraits_2)



#### ASSUMPTION CHECKS 
# DHARMa checks 
plot(simulateResiduals(glm.nb_pupae.at)) 
## qq looks a lot better, BUT there are still significant P values
 # sig test for deviation, and uniformity 

## Performance checks
check_zeroinflation(glm.nb_pupae.at)
## No zeroinflation 
check_overdispersion(glm.nb_pupae.at) 
## No overdispersion 





## Comparing models:
AIC(glmm.p.pupae.at,glm.nb_pupae.at)
# Negative Binomial GLM is lower, but only slightly
# It is still not a great model... need to research into what models could be better






## Using Negative Binomial GLM (FOR NOW)... 
glm.nb_pupae.at <- glm.nb(time_hours  ~ 
                         treatment  
                       
                       , data = pupae_fitness_adultstraits_2)



#### 2. Data analysis with chosen model ####

# Basic analysis 
summary(glm.nb_pupae.at)
 # no sig differences, unconditioned took slightlyyy less time

# Confidence intervals
exp(confint(glm.nb_pupae.at))

# Getting real values for write-up 
emmeans::emmeans(glm.nb_pupae.at, specs =  ~ treatment, type = "response")


# Generating a table 
tab_model(glm.nb_pupae.at, CSS = list(css.table = '+font-family: Arial;'))
