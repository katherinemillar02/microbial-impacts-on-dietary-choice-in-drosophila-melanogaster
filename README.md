# The effects of fly contaminated diets on dietary choice in mated female *Drosophila melanogaster*

This is a GitHub Repository for my Masters of Science by Research Project. 

Enjoy.

My research project is aimed at researching the effects of diets which have previously had flies on them, and how this influences dietary choice through leaving behind gut microbes, pheromones, and the effects of diets which have been digested.

*__Figure 1: Schematic of the ideas associated with the experimental designs__.* Figure shows a fly leaving behind faeces on a diet, and how this is associated with pheromones and microbes, and how this diet will be used for female patch preference assays.

This project studies the effects of sex-specific fly contaminated diets and how they may leave behind      
- Microbes (Acetobacter, Lactobacillus)
- Pheromones (cVA, CHs)
- Change digestive texture of diet

The experiments as part of this project: 

Diets Conditioned with __males__     


First project experiment:         
(i) conditioned treatment (4:1 C + 1:4 C)     
(ii) conditioned and unconditioned treatment (4:1 C, 1:4 C, 4:1 UC, 1:4 UC)      
(iii) unconditioned treatment (4:1 UC + 1:4 UC)


Second project experiment:           
(i) 4:1 conditioned and unconditioned treatment (4:1 C + 4:1 UC)          
(ii) 1:4 conditioned and unconditioned treatment (1:4 C + 1:4 UC)     
(iii) 1:4 and 4:1 conditioned and unconditioned treatment (4:1 C, 1:4 C, 4:1 UC,1:4 UC)
