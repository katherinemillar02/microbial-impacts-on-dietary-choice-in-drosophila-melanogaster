# Effects of microbe deposition, pheromone deposition, and the social environment on dietary choice in mated female *Drosophila melanogaster*.

A GitHub Repository for a research project undertaken at the University of East Anglia.

This project tested how mated females choose feeding and oviposition sites based on diets with varying protein-to-carbohydrate (P:C) ratios, particularly when those diets have been previously occupied by other flies. It also explored how these choices affect pre-adult development, as well as adult traits such as reproductive success and lifespan.
