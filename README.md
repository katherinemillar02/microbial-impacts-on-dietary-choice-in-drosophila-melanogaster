## 🗂 Scripts 📜

### 🗂️ Chapter 2 -  dietary-choice: Effects of a Conditioned Diet on Dietary Choice: 

 #### 🗂 relative 

    ##### official.relative.feeding.analysis.R 
This script contains just the analysis for with the correct model chosen from the model assumptions (in preliminary.relative.feeding.analysis.R). This also contains code used for written analysis. 
  
    ##### official.relative.oviposition.analysis.R 
This script contains just the analysis for with the correct model chosen from the model assumptions (in preliminary.relative.feeding.analysis.R). This also contains code used for written analysis.

    ##### preliminary.relative.feeding.analysis.R 
This script is a preliminary to official.relative.feeding.analysis.R, where I went through different models and tested assumptions for the best fit.
  
    ##### preliminary.relative.oviposition.analysis.R 
This script is a preliminary to official.relative.oviposition.analysis.R, where I went through different models and tested assumptions for the best fit.

NEED TO EDIT SCRIPTS¡¡



 #### 🗂 data_visualisation 
  
    ##### data_visualisation_feeding.R    
This script includes visualisation for the preferred feeding diet for a mated female when allowed to choose across different diets that have been conditioned or unconditioned. There are boxplots which show experimental repeats which have been combined, and plots for separate blocks. 

    ###### data_visualisation_oviposition.R 
This script includes visualisation for the preferred oviposition diet for a mated female when allowed to choose across different diets that have been conditioned or unconditioned. There are boxplots which show experimental repeats which have been combined, and plots for separate blocks.
