# The effects of fly contaminated diets on dietary choice in mated female *Drosophila melanogaster*

This is a GitHub Repository for my Masters of Science by Research Project. 

My research project is aimed at researching the effects of diets which have previously had flies on them, and how this influences dietary choice through leaving behind gut microbes, pheromones, and the effects of diets which have been digested.

This project studies the effects of sex-specific fly contaminated diets and how they may leave behind      
- Microbes (Acetobacter, Lactobacillus)
- Pheromones (cVA, CHs)
- Change digestive texture of diet
