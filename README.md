## 🗂 Scripts 📜

### 🗂️ Chapter 2 -  dietary-choice: Effects of a Conditioned Diet on Dietary Choice: 

 #### 🗂 relative 

 #### 🗂 absolute 

 #### 🗂 data_visualisation 

 #### data_visualisation_feeding.R    
This script includes visualisation for the preferred feeding diet for a mated female when allowed to choose across different diets that have been conditioned or unconditioned. There are boxplots which show experimental repeats which have been combined, and plots for separate blocks. 

 #### data_visualisation_oviposition.R 
This script includes visualisation for the preferred oviposition diet for a mated female when allowed to choose across different diets that have been conditioned or unconditioned. There are boxplots which show experimental repeats which have been combined, and plots for separate blocks.

### 🗂️ Chapter 4 Supplementary Material-  density-conditioning: Effects of Conditoning Density on Dietary Choice:

 #### 🗂 relative 
 
 ##### relative_dose_ovi.R            
This script contains data analysis for oviposition behaviour, from the assays which were in a relative     (four-choice) environment at both 35 mm and 90 mm. 
 
 ##### relative_dose_feeding.R
This script contains data analysis for feeding behaviour, from the assays which were in a relative (four-choice) environment at both 35 mm and 90 mm. 
 
 
 #### 🗂 absolute
 
 ##### absolute_dose_ovi.R
 ##### absolute_dose_feeding.R
 
 
 #### 🗂 data_visualisation 
 
 ##### density_oviposition_visualisation.R
 ##### density_feeding_visualisation.R
 


### density_feeding.R   
A script for visualising and analysing the data of the denisty feeding experiments. 


### 🗂️power-analysis: Using previous data to check power of future experiments.

#### poweranalysis-microbialwash.R
Using this for the microbial wash experiment.

#### poweranalysis-fitness.R
Seeing if I have enough repeats for the development experiment.

#### poweranalysis-densityexperiment.R
A simulation which allows one to see if the dietary assays will have enough power for the density conditioning dietary choice experiment.

#### old-power-analysis-script.R
The original power analysis script worked on. 

#### poweranalysis-microbialwash.R
A simulation which allows one to see if the dietary assays will have enough power for the microbial wash dietary choice experiment.
