# Effects of microbe deposition, pheromone deposition, and the social environment on dietary choice in mated female *Drosophila melanogaster*.

A GitHub Repository for a research project undertaken at the University of East Anglia.

This project investigates the effects of a mated females feeding and oviposition choice, of diets of different Protein: Carbohydrate ratios that have been pre-occupied by other flies. As well as the effects of these choices on pre-adult development, and the the effects these choices have on traits as adults, such as reproductive success and lifespan.
