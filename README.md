# Effects of microbe deposition, pheromone deposition, and the social environment on dietary choice in mated female *Drosophila melanogaster*.

A GitHub Repository for a research project undertaken at the University of East Anglia. 

This project investigates the effects of a mated females feeding and oviposition choice, of diets of different
Protein: Carbohydrate ratios that have been pre-occupied by other flies. As well as the effects of these choices on
pre-adult development, and the the effects these choices have on traits as adults, such as reproductive success and 
lifespan.
