#### DATA ANALYSIS 
# OvoD1 Oviposition
binomial_model_ovod1_oviposition <- glm(cbind(Conditioned, Unconditioned) ~ ratio, family = binomial, data = df2_ovod1_oviposition)
## looking at model 
summary(binomial_model_ovod1_oviposition) # 4:1 Conditioned is significant?


# Male Oviposition
binomial_model_male_oviposition <- glm(cbind(Conditioned, Unconditioned) ~ ratio, family = binomial, data = df2_male_oviposition)
## looking at model 
summary(binomial_model_male_oviposition) # 4:1 Conditioned is very significant?
